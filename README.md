## Description 
 
  This is a kanban board type app. It allows users to organize tasks for multiple projects as they complete different aspects of it. They'll be able to track the items they've completed and what's left as well as items they'd like to add one day in the future.

## Usage 
As a user, I have a lot of different tasks to do, and I want to keep them organized on a kanban-like interface.
